# Exploding robot head

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Use `position` and coordinates to put the robot’s head together.
- Hovering anywhere over the robot should explode the head to reveal the brain and insides.
- Some of the CSS is already written for you, specifically the widths of the robot pieces.
- **DO NOT change the HTML.**
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Optional challenges

*These challenges are here if you’d like to try a little more work—they are for extra experience and learning. They are completely optional and not graded. Show them to me if you’d like—I’d love to see them.*

1. Use the CSS `transition` property to make the bits animated when hovered.
